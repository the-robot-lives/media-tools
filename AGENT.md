# AGENT.md — media-tool

Guidance for **Codex**, **Grok**, **Cursor**, and other `AGENTS.md` / `AGENT.md` tools.

Claude Code loads [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md). Same policy; this file is the harness-shaped sibling (numbered MUST first, markdown headings). If both this file and a parent `AGENTS.md` load, **this file wins on conflict**.

## MUST (every turn)

1. **Trinity Protocol (REQUIRED)**: substantive responses run Orientation → Friction → Response (assumptions surfaced; WEDGE/SHADOW/CRITIC; meta-review). Full text: trl-infra `protocols/the-trinity-protocol.md` (+ `.summary.md`).
2. **No shell in the main thread** — delegate lookups/builds/test runs to tasker subagents; they report answers, not raw output.
3. **Branch workflow** (from this repo's own .git). Integration-testing consolidation branches: `epic.<group>` forked from `develop` (`feature/if-testing-just-one` for single items); feature→epic merges use PR + squash flow for provenance; a fully-passing epic becomes one PR for the group.
4. **PRs target `develop`.** Never merge or push `main` (CI/CD-only release path).

## Identity

Media-generation CLI (generate-media-prompt etc.): .media.prompt schema 0.4 YAML; qwen-image via DashScope intl endpoint. Gotcha: installed binary can lag source — rebuild from source (make build/install) before trusting behavior. develop is the default branch (retry work merged).

Part of the Noizu utilities fleet (trl-infra monorepo, `Portfolio/Utilities/source/*`). Installed to `~/.local/bin` via monorepo root `make install-utilities`; some packages are also dual-path registered at repo-root `utilities/<group>/` (same remote/SHA).

## Commands

```bash
make test      # test target (see Makefile; some are no-op placeholders)
make install   # install binaries/completions to ~/.local/bin
```

## Worktrees — Canonical Convention (REQUIRED)

All work happens on git worktrees, created from **this repo's own `.git`** — never work directly on a shared checkout of `develop`/`main`.

- **Placement (fixed):** every worktree lives inside this repo's checkout at **`.claude/worktrees/<name>/`** — never siblings (`<repo>.worktrees/`), never ad-hoc paths. Matches Claude Code's native worktree tooling, so harness-created and manual worktrees coexist.
- **Naming:** `<name>` = branch name with `/` → `-` (branch `feature/vfs-wave1` → `.claude/worktrees/feature-vfs-wave1`).
- **Creation** — from this repo's own `.git`, based on `develop` (never `main`):
  ```bash
  git -C <this-repo> worktree add .claude/worktrees/<name> -b <branch> develop
  ```
- **Hygiene:** `.claude/worktrees/` is gitignored in this repo; never commit its contents. One worktree per task; remove it when the work lands (`git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/<name>` — keep the branch).
- **Addressing:** `git -C <this-repo>/.claude/worktrees/<name> …`; verify branch + clean index before any git write; no `git stash`.
- **Elixir projects:** the MAIN checkout owns `deps/` + `_build/`; each worktree symlinks `deps` (and `_build` where needed) to the canonical checkout by **absolute path** — no per-worktree re-fetch/recompile.
- **Legacy placements** (`.worktrees/`, `.wt/`, `<repo>.worktrees/` siblings, `staging/`) are grandfathered — do not create new ones; migrate opportunistically. `staging/` remains local-only experiments (never pushed/submoduled).

## Branch & PR Policy

- Submodules sit on **`develop`** — keep your checkout on `develop`.
- All PRs target **`develop`** (feature/bug/task branches fork from `develop`).
- **`main` is CI/CD-only**: CI/CD automation performs all merges into `main` (release path). Never merge to or push `main` by hand.
